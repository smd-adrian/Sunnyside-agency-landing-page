## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic **HTML5 markup**
-   **CSS custom properties**
-   **Flexbox**
-   **CSS Grid**
-   **Mobile-first workflow**
-   **Bootstrap 5.3.3** for responsive components
-   **Normalize.css** for consistent browser styling
-   **Sass** for modular and maintainable styles
-   **Laravel Mix** for asset compilation

---

### What I learned

During this project I reinforced my skills in:

-   Creating responsive layouts with Bootstrap Grid and custom Sass.
-   Organizing styles in partials using Sass for better maintainability.
-   Using Laravel Mix for compiling Sass and optimizing assets.

---

### Continued development

For future projects, I’d like to:

-   Use Vite for asset compilation.
-   Use Vue.js for component-based development.

---
